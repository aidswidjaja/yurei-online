<h4>HOW TO PLAY</h4>
<ul>
	<li>To participate, use the <b>official post-jam speedrun build</b> available at <a href="http://heyo.adrian.id.au/yurei-online/index.html">http://heyo.adrian.id.au/yurei-online/index.html</a>.</li>
	<li>You can press the <kbd>O</kbd> (the letter "o") key to reset back to level 1</li>
	<li>All speedruns are counted from level 1 to thank-you screen</li>
	<li>When you reach the end, you'll see a screen with the number of seconds it took for you to complete the game (starting at level 1) - feel free to screenshot to show off to your friends</li>
	<li>Submit your username and then click the button to submit your score here</li>
</ul>

<h4>HOW TO READ</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The <code>Score</code> column can be ignored</li>
	<li>The <code>Text</code> column contains the number of seconds from start of level 1 to thank-you screen, to a double-precision floating point</li>
	<li><b>Times tagged with M were runs that were manually timed</b> before this system got implemented</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This game was originally submitted for Ludum Dare 49, but the speedrun build with support for online score submission was developed post-jam</em></p>
